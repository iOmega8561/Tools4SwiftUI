    /// A system-inspired default corner radius that adapts to the current Apple platform and OS version.
    ///
    /// This value is **not officially documented by Apple**, but has been determined through **empirical inspection**
    /// of system controls across multiple platforms and OS versions using tools like Xcode’s View Debugger,
    /// layer property introspection, and pixel-accurate comparison against native UI components.
    ///
    /// - On **macOS 15 and earlier**, system buttons and containers typically use a `5 pt` corner radius.
    /// - On **macOS 26 (Tahoe)** and newer, the system standard shifts to `8 pt` for buttons, sheets, and panels,
    ///   aligning with iOS and iPadOS conventions.
    /// - On **iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS**, the typical system radius is `8 pt`.
    /// - On **tvOS**, system cards and buttons use larger radii (typically `12–16 pt`) for better visibility.
    /// - On **visionOS**, spatial panels use radii in the range of `10–12 pt`.
    ///
    /// While these values are not official, they reflect **Apple’s current visual design across platforms** as seen in
    /// system apps and SwiftUI-rendered controls. This property is useful for achieving a native-feeling interface
    /// while maintaining consistency and adaptability across platforms.
    ///
    /// > ⚠️ This API does not guarantee future-proof visual parity with Apple’s UI. Always prefer native controls like
    /// > `.buttonStyle(.bordered)` or SwiftUI containers where possible to inherit system styling automatically.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A `CGFloat` representing the default corner radius appropriate for the current platform and version.
