/// `ComplexPicker` is a flexible picker component for selecting an item from a heterogeneous collection.
///
/// This view is designed to handle collections of heterogeneous types, allowing for highly customizable item
/// rendering and filtering. The picker displays the filtered items as buttons, each styled with a rounded rectangle.
/// Selected items are visually distinguished, and the component ensures smooth interaction.
///
/// - Note:
///   - The component is generic over the collection (`Value`) and its elements (`Value.Element`), requiring
///     the elements to conform to `Hashable` for unique identification.
///   - The rendering and filtering of items are fully customizable via closures provided during initialization.
///
/// - Generics:
///   - `Value`: The collection type (e.g., `Array`, `Set`) from which items are picked. Must conform to `RandomAccessCollection`.
///   - `Label`: The view used to display each item.
public struct ComplexPicker<Value: RandomAccessCollection, Label: View>: View where Value.Element: Hashable {
    
    /// The collection of items to display in the picker.
    ///
    /// The items in `array` can be of any type, as long as they conform to `Hashable`. Only the items that pass
    /// the filtering criteria specified by `filter` are displayed.
    private let array: Value
    
    /// A closure used to filter the items in the collection.
    ///
    /// The `filter` closure is applied to each element in `array` to determine whether it should be displayed.
    /// By default, all items are included.
    private let filter: (Value.Element) -> Bool
    
    /// A binding to the currently selected item.
    ///
    /// The selected item is updated when a button representing an item is tapped. The binding ensures two-way
    /// synchronization with the state in the parent view.
