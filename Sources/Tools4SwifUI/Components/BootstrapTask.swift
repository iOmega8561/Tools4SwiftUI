/// `BootstrapTask` is a view modifier that runs an asynchronous task only once per view lifecycle.
///
/// This modifier provides a way to execute an asynchronous task when the view appears, ensuring
/// the task only runs once by tracking its completion state. This is useful for initialization
/// tasks that should only be performed once, such as loading data or setting up necessary resources.
///
/// - Note: This modifier leverages `@State` with an `Observable` object (`StateHolder`) to
/// track the task's completion state, ensuring it is only executed once.
public struct BootstrapTask: ViewModifier {
    
    /// A private class to hold and observe the taskâ€™s completion state.
    ///
    /// `StateHolder` is an `@Observable` class that tracks whether the task has been completed.
    /// By making it `Observable`, SwiftUI automatically updates the view when the `isDone`
    /// property changes, though in this context, it's primarily used to prevent re-execution.
    ///
    /// - Properties:
    ///   - `isDone`: A private(set) Boolean that tracks whether the task has been completed.
    private class StateHolder: Observation.Observable {
        
        /// A Boolean indicating whether the task has already completed.
        ///
        /// Once `isDone` is set to `true`, the task will not run again in this view's lifecycle.
        private(set) var isDone: Bool = false

    ///
    /// `handler` is an asynchronous throwing closure that will be executed when the view appears.
    /// If the task completes successfully, no further actions are taken. If an error occurs, it
    /// is handled by displaying an alert through `TesseractError`.

    /// An instance of `StateHolder` to track whether the task has already run.
    ///
    /// Using `@State` ensures that `stateHolder` is unique to this view instance, and SwiftUI
    /// retains its state across re-renders. By tracking the task's completion state, `stateHolder`
    /// helps ensure the task only executes once.
    @State private var stateHolder: StateHolder = .init()
    
    /// The body of the view modifier, which applies the `task` modifier to execute the asynchronous handler.
    ///
    /// The `task` modifier initiates the asynchronous task with a `.userInitiated` priority. Inside the task,
    /// a check is performed to ensure that the task has not already completed by verifying `isDone` in `stateHolder`.
    /// If the task has not run yet:
    /// - `stateHolder.setDone()` is called to mark it as completed.
    /// - The task is then executed.
    /// - If an error occurs, it is displayed to the user via `TesseractError`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - content: The view content to which this modifier is applied.
    /// - Returns: A view with the asynchronous task applied, which runs once upon view appearance.
